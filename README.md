# shopping list

thanks for checking this out, this is my first desktop application that I built using a YouTube video guide from Traversy media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN1Czs0m1SU). I don't know if I'll edit this to make it nicer or more customized because it was mostly just a practice with creating and packaging the code.
